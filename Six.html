Austin is a multi-meadia artist based in California currently persuing his BFA in Pictorial art at San Jose State University. His philosophy concerns process oriented art based on using found paper, wood and discarded objects he finds in the streets, under bridges and in thrift stores to paint, draw or print on. The idea of using found objects is to give new life and value to items that were once valuealbe but later tossed and neglected. This process of this is a never ending process of searching, finding and producing which the outdoors become an extention of the "studio." </p></center>
